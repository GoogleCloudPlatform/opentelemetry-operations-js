# OpenTelemetry Fastify instrumentation example

This is the code sample for [Generate traces and metrics with
Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/instrumentation/setup/nodejs).

This sample is a [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) Node.js application instrumented with
[OpenTelemetry JS auto instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/automatic/).
This is a Node.js version of [this golang
sample](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples/tree/main/opentelemetry/instrumentation).
It uses docker compose to orchestrate running the application and sending it some requests.

The code is a basic Fastify application with two endpoints
- `/multi` makes a few requests to `/single` on localhost
- `/single` sleeps for a short time to simulate work

Docker compose also runs the OpenTelemetry collector, set up to receive telemetry from the
application and parse its logs from a shared volume. Finally, a loadgen container sends
requests to the app.

## Permissions

This sample writes to Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Cloud Trace. Grant yourself the
following roles to run the example:
- `roles/logging.logWriter` – see https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control#permissions_and_roles
- `roles/monitoring.metricWriter` – see https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/access-control#predefined_roles
- `roles/cloudtrace.agent` – see https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/iam#trace-roles

## Running the example

### Cloud Shell or GCE

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-js.git
cd opentelemetry-operations-js/samples/instrumentation-quickstart
docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit
```

### Locally with Application Default Credentials

First Create local credentials by running the following command and following the
oauth2 flow (read more about the command [here][auth_command]):

	gcloud auth application-default login

> [!CAUTION]
> This method of authentication is not recommended for production environments.

Executing this command will save your application credentials to the default path which will depend on the type of machine -
- Linux, macOS: `$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json`

Next, export the credentials to `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable -

For Linux & MacOS:
```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
```

For Windows:
```shell
SET GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=%APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json
```

You can also manually set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to a service account key JSON file path.

Learn more at [Setting Up Authentication for Server to Server Production Applications][ADC].

*Note:* Application Default Credentials is able to implicitly find the credentials as long as the application is running on Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, or Cloud Functions.

Then run the example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/opentelemetry-operations-js.git
cd opentelemetry-operations-js/samples/instrumentation-quickstart

# Lets collector read mounted config
export USERID="$(id -u)"
# Specify the project ID
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your project id>
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.creds.yaml up  --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Viewing the results

After a successful run of the example, you can see the generated metrics in the GCP console via Metrics Explorer. The generated metrics would be present under the `Prometheus Target` resource.

Similarly, to view the generated traces in the GCP console, use the Trace Explorer.
