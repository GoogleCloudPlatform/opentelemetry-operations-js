# OpenTelemetry Google Cloud Trace Exporter

OpenTelemetry Google Cloud Trace Exporter allows the user to send collected traces to Google Cloud.

[Google Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace) is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data.

## Setup

Google Cloud Trace is a managed service provided by Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @google-cloud/opentelemetry-cloud-trace-exporter
```

## Usage
Install the exporter on your application, register the exporter, and start tracing. If you are running in a GCP environment, the exporter will automatically authenticate using the environment's service account. If not, you will need to follow the instructions in  [Authentication](#Authentication).

```js
const { StackdriverTraceExporter } = require('@google-cloud/opentelemetry-cloud-trace-exporter');

const exporter = new StackdriverTraceExporter({
  // If you are not in a GCP environment, you will need to provide your
  // service account key here. See the Authentication section below.
});
```

Now, register the exporter.

```js
provider.addSpanProcessor(new BatchSpanProcessor(exporter));
```

You can use built-in `SimpleSpanProcessor` or `BatchSpanProcessor` or write your own.

- [SimpleSpanProcessor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/sdk-tracing.md#simple-processor): The implementation of `SpanProcessor` that passes ended span directly to the configured `SpanExporter`.
- [BatchSpanProcessor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/sdk-tracing.md#batching-processor): The implementation of the `SpanProcessor` that batches ended spans and pushes them to the configured `SpanExporter`. It is recommended to use this `SpanProcessor` for better performance and optimization.

## Authentication

The Stackdriver Trace exporter supports authentication using service accounts. These can either be defined in a keyfile (usually called `service_account_key.json` or similar), or by the environment. If your application runs in a GCP environment, such as Compute Engine, you don't need to provide any application credentials. The client library will find the credentials by itself. For more information, go to <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/>.

### Service account key

If you are not running in a GCP environment, you will need to give the service account credentials to the exporter.

```js
const { StackdriverTraceExporter } = require('@google-cloud/opentelemetry-cloud-trace-exporter');

const exporter = new StackdriverTraceExporter({
  /** option 1. provide a service account key json */
  keyFile: './service_account_key.json',
  keyFileName: './service_account_key.json',

  /** option 2. provide credentials directly */
  credentials: {
    client_email: string,
    private_key: string,
  },
});
```
